# H1_Extra_Josephus_problem

This is a 4 out of 4 difficulty extra assignment.

Filler content:
How do you avoid being executed? Or just being picked in round ball? 
The Josephus problem dates all the way back to the Roman times, and this pattern is used a lot in math and computer science.
In this assignment you have to figure out which position is best to stand on, based on the following:
There are 41 hostages, whom will be executed by their kidnappers. All are in a circle and every 3rd person has to be executed until there is just 1 hostage left.
Which start position should that person have?
This pattern (find it at H1_Extra_Josephus_problem/H1_Extra_Josephus_problem/Illustration.jpg) is called a cyclist pattern which repeats itself.
In the illustration is it number 31 which goes free.

Assignment:
Create a program which can load the amount of soldiers (n) and the kill interval (k). 
It should output the survivors position.
Test the program using n=41 and k=3 and see if you get the result 31.
